postgresql-10 (10.15-0ubuntu0.18.04.1) bionic-security; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version.
    + Block DECLARE CURSOR ... WITH HOLD and firing of deferred triggers
      within index expressions and materialized view queries (Noah Misch)

      This is essentially a leak in the security restricted operation sandbox
      mechanism.  An attacker having permission to create non-temporary SQL
      objects could parlay this leak to execute arbitrary SQL code as a
      superuser.

      The PostgreSQL Project thanks Etienne Stalmans for reporting this
      problem. (CVE-2020-25695)

    + Fix usage of complex connection-string parameters in pg_dump,
      pg_restore, clusterdb, reindexdb, and vacuumdb (Tom Lane)

      The -d parameter of pg_dump and pg_restore, or the --maintenance-db
      parameter of the other programs mentioned, can be a connection string
      containing multiple connection parameters rather than just a database
      name.  In cases where these programs need to initiate additional
      connections, such as parallel processing or processing of multiple
      databases, the connection string was forgotten and just the basic
      connection parameters (database name, host, port, and username) were
      used for the additional connections.  This could lead to connection
      failures if the connection string included any other essential
      information, such as non-default SSL or GSS parameters. Worse, the
      connection might succeed but not be encrypted as intended, or be
      vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks that the intended connection
      parameters would have prevented. (CVE-2020-25694)

    + When psql's \connect command re-uses connection parameters, ensure that
      all non-overridden parameters from a previous connection string are
      re-used (Tom Lane)

      This avoids cases where reconnection might fail due to omission of
      relevant parameters, such as non-default SSL or GSS options. Worse, the
      reconnection might succeed but not be encrypted as intended, or be
      vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks that the intended connection
      parameters would have prevented. This is largely the same problem as
      just cited for pg_dump et al, although psql's behavior is more complex
      since the user may intentionally override some connection parameters.
      (CVE-2020-25694)

    + Prevent psql's \gset command from modifying specially-treated variables
      (Noah Misch)

      \gset without a prefix would overwrite whatever variables the server
      told it to.  Thus, a compromised server could set specially-treated
      variables such as PROMPT1, giving the ability to execute arbitrary shell
      code in the user's session.

      The PostgreSQL Project thanks Nick Cleaton for reporting this problem.

  * New upstream release (LP: #1892335).
    - Set a secure search_path in logical replication walsenders and apply
      workers (Noah Misch)

      A malicious user of either the publisher or subscriber database could
      potentially cause execution of arbitrary SQL code by the role running
      replication, which is often a superuser.  Some of the risks here are
      equivalent to those described in CVE-2018-1058, and are mitigated in
      this patch by ensuring that the replication sender and receiver execute
      with empty search_path settings. (As with CVE-2018-1058, that change
      might cause problems for under-qualified names used in replicated
      tables' DDL.)  Other risks are inherent in replicating objects that
      belong to untrusted roles; the most we can do is document that there is
      a hazard to consider.
      CVE-2020-14349

    - Make contrib modules' installation scripts more secure (Tom Lane)

      Attacks similar to those described in CVE-2018-1058 could be carried out
      against an extension installation script, if the attacker can create
      objects in either the extension's target schema or the schema of some
      prerequisite extension.  Since extensions often require superuser
      privilege to install, this can open a path to obtaining superuser
      privilege.  To mitigate this risk, be more careful about the search_path
      used to run an installation script; disable check_function_bodies within
      the script; and fix catalog-adjustment queries used in some contrib
      modules to ensure they are secure.  Also provide documentation to help
      third-party extension authors make their installation scripts secure.
      This is not a complete solution; extensions that depend on other
      extensions can still be at risk if installed carelessly.

  * New upstream release (LP: #1786938)
    - Fix failure to reset libpq's state fully between connection attempts
      .
      An unprivileged user of dblink or postgres_fdw could bypass the checks
      intended to prevent use of server-side credentials, such as a ~/.pgpass
      file owned by the operating-system user running the server.  Servers
      allowing peer authentication on local connections are particularly
      vulnerable.  Other attacks such as SQL injection into a postgres_fdw
      session are also possible. Attacking postgres_fdw in this way requires
      the ability to create a foreign server object with selected connection
      parameters, but any user with access to dblink could exploit the
      problem. In general, an attacker with the ability to select the
      connection parameters for a libpq-using application could cause
      mischief, though other plausible attack scenarios are harder to think
      of. Our thanks to Andrew Krasichkov for reporting this issue.

      that an attacking user lacks UPDATE privilege for, if that user has
      INSERT and UPDATE privileges for some other column(s) of the table. Any
      user could also use it for disclosure of server memory.

postgresql-10 (10.3-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version.

    If you run an installation in which not all users are mutually
    trusting, or if you maintain an application or extension that is
    intended for use in arbitrary situations, it is strongly recommended
    that you read the documentation changes described in the first changelog
    entry below, and take suitable steps to ensure that your installation or
    code is secure.

    Also, the changes described in the second changelog entry below may
    cause functions used in index expressions or materialized views to fail
    during auto-analyze, or when reloading from a dump.  After upgrading,
    monitor the server logs for such problems, and fix affected functions.

    + Document how to configure installations and applications to guard
      against search-path-dependent trojan-horse attacks from other users

      Using a search_path setting that includes any schemas writable by a
      hostile user enables that user to capture control of queries and then
      run arbitrary SQL code with the permissions of the attacked user.  While
      it is possible to write queries that are proof against such hijacking,
      it is notationally tedious, and it's very easy to overlook holes.
      Therefore, we now recommend configurations in which no untrusted schemas
      appear in one's search path.
      (CVE-2018-1058)

    + Avoid use of insecure search_path settings in pg_dump and other client
      programs

      pg_dump, pg_upgrade, vacuumdb and other PostgreSQL-provided applications
      were themselves vulnerable to the type of hijacking described in the
      previous changelog entry; since these applications are commonly run by
      superusers, they present particularly attractive targets.  To make them
      secure whether or not the installation as a whole has been secured,
      modify them to include only the pg_catalog schema in their search_path
      settings. Autovacuum worker processes now do the same, as well.

      In cases where user-provided functions are indirectly executed by these
      programs -- for example, user-provided functions in index expressions --
      the tighter search_path may result in errors, which will need to be
      corrected by adjusting those user-provided functions to not assume
      anything about what search path they are invoked under.  That has always
      been good practice, but now it will be necessary for correct behavior.

  * New upstream version.
    + Fix processing of partition keys containing multiple expressions
      (CVE-2018-1052)

    + Ensure that all temporary files made by pg_upgrade are
      non-world-readable (CVE-2018-1053)

    + Change the behavior of contrib/cube's cube ~> int operator to make it
      compatible with KNN search.

      The meaning of the second argument (the dimension selector) has been
      changed to make it predictable which value is selected even when
      dealing with cubes of varying dimensionalities.

      This is an incompatible change, but since the point of the operator
      was to be used in KNN searches, it seems rather useless as-is.
      After installing this update, any expression indexes or materialized
      views using this operator will need to be reindexed/refreshed.

  * New upstream version.

    + Ensure that INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE checks table permissions
      and RLS policies in all cases (Dean Rasheed)

      The update path of INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE requires SELECT
      permission on the columns of the arbiter index, but it failed to check
      for that in the case of an arbiter specified by constraint name. In
      addition, for a table with row level security enabled, it failed to
      check updated rows against the table's SELECT policies (regardless of
      how the arbiter index was specified). (CVE-2017-15099)

    + Fix crash due to rowtype mismatch in json{b}_populate_recordset()
      (Michael Paquier, Tom Lane)

      These functions used the result rowtype specified in the FROM ... AS
      clause without checking that it matched the actual rowtype of the
      supplied tuple value.  If it didn't, that would usually result in a
      crash, though disclosure of server memory contents seems possible as
      well. (CVE-2017-15098)

    + Fix BRIN index summarization to handle concurrent table extension
      correctly (Álvaro Herrera)

      Previously, a race condition allowed some table rows to be omitted from
      the index.  It may be necessary to reindex existing BRIN indexes to
      recover from past occurrences of this problem.
